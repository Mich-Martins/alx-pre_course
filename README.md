My first readme

I was able to succesfully work from the command terminal by learning quite a few things.
i understood the use of the follwing command line

cd for moving to the next directory
ls for cecking the current file or folder in that directory
rm for removing a file
rmdir for removing a directory
cat for ...
echo for writting a sentence

and some other command that will be updated shortly
